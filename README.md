## Description
This Project was built as Semester project for my Data Structures and Algorithm Course. It is built using Language named "Processing".
The code generates a maze using Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm and then applies the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the start block to the end block. It Visualises Each Block the Algorithm visits while searching.
## Usage

To run the Project, follow these steps:
1. Install Processing from [Processing.org](https://processing.org/download)).
2. Open Processing IDE: Launch the Processing IDE after installation.
3. In the Processing IDE, go to File > Open and navigate to the folder where your Project is Located and Select the maze.pde file of your sketch and open it
4. After the file is opened you can run it by clicking the "Play" button in the toolbar
